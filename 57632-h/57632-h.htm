  The Legend of the Lincoln Imp<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  The devil was in a good humour one day,<br />
  And let out his sprightly young demons to play.<br />
  One dived in the sea, and was not at all wet,<br />
  One jumped in a furnace: no scorch did he get;<br />
  One rode on a rainbow; one delved in the dirt;<br />
  One handled fork lightning, nor got any hurt;<br />
  One strode on the wind as he would on a steed,<br />
  And thus to old Lindum was carried with speed,<br />
  Where aldermen heard him conceitedly say<br />
  "There'll be, ere I leave it, the devil to pay."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-001"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-001.jpg" alt="One strode on the wind as he would on a steed" />
<br />
One strode on the wind as he would on a steed
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  "And now," says the Imp, "take me into the church;<br />
  "His lordship of Lindum I'll knock off his perch;<br />
  "I'll blow up the chapter, and blow up the dean;<br />
  "The canons I'll cannon right over the screen;<br />
  "I'll blow up the singers, bass, tenor, and boy;<br />
  "And the blower himself shall a blowing enjoy;<br />
  "The organist, too, shall right speedily find<br />
  "That I'll go one better in raising the wind;<br />
  "I'll blow out the windows, and blow out the lights,<br />
  "Tear vestments to tatters, put ritual to rights!<br />
  "And e'en the poor verger who comes in my road<br />
  "Will find"&mdash;vulgar Imp!&mdash;"he may likewise be blow'd."<br />

<br />
&quot;He may likewise be blow'd.&quot;
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  Now the wind has his faults, but you'll find on the whole<br />
  If somewhat uncouth, he's an orthodox soul;<br />
  He wouldn't blow hard on a monarch, I ween,<br />
  Nor ruffle the robes of a bishop or dean;<br />
  And if for dissenters he cares not the least,<br />
  You won't catch him blowing up deacon or priest;<br />
  The man in the street he may rudely unrig,<br />
  But he snatches not judge's or barrister's wig.<br />
  When he enters a church, as the musical know,<br />
  'Tis only to make the sweet organ-pipes blow:<br />
  The toot on the "choir" or the "swell" or the "great,"<br />
  And hence at the Imp he was justly irate;<br />
  So in sorrowful anger he said to the elf,<br />
  "No! here I shall stop, you may go by yourself."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  The impudent elf in derision replied,<br />
  "Such half-hearted folks are much better outside;<br />
  "To force you to enter I cannot, but see,<br />
  "Till I've finished my fun, you must wait here for me."<br />

A grotesque sculpture on a pinnacle over <br />

<p class="noindent">
  Then he entered the porch in an imp-ious way,<br />
  Declaring the nave should be spelt with a K;<br />
  He roamed through each transept, he strolled in each aisle,<br />
  Then he thought in the choir he would romp for a while.<br />
  As he passed 'neath the rood no obeisance he made;<br />
  No rev'rence at all to the altar he paid;<br />
  He thumbed all the canons' and choristers' books,<br />
  And cast on the saints his most insolent looks;<br />
  The chalice and patens were safe in a box,<br />
  He was stopped in the act of unpicking the locks.<br />
  He hacked at the lectern and chopped at the stalls;<br />
  The tapestry tore from the sanctified walls;<br />
  Incensed against incense, the thuribles he<br />
  Demolished; the candlesticks broke on his knee.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
The candlesticks broke on his knee.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  Then seeing some angels he cried, "Pretty things,<br />
  "A sackful of feathers I'll pluck from your wings<br />
  "To make me a couch when I'm tired of this joke,"<br />
  Ah! soon he was sorry that rudely he spoke;<br />
  For the tiniest angel, with amethyst eyes<br />
  And hair like spun gold, 'fore the altar did rise,<br />
  Pronouncing these words in a dignified tone<br />
  "O impious Imp, be ye turned into stone!"<br />
  So he was, as you'll see when to Lincoln you stray:<br />
  And the wind has been waiting outside till this day.<br />
  You can't see the wind, but no matter for that<br />
  Believe, or he'll rob you of cloak or of hat.<br />

<br />
He'll rob you of cloak or of hat.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  MORAL<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  This moral, I trust, you'll deduce from my lay&mdash;<br />
  If ever you're minded the mischief to play.<br />
  Be sure that you're able the "needful" to find,<br />
  In other words, certain of "raising the wind";<br />
  And then, when you're bent upon "going the pace,"<br />
  Don't count on the wind, or I pity your case.<br />
  There are bikes at your service, and motors galore.<br />
  Steam, gas, and electric machines by the score;<br />
  Again, if for skittish amusement you search.<br />
  Don't meddle, I pray, with affairs of the church.<br />
  The puppets of politics&mdash;all will admit&mdash;<br />
  Are legitimate sport for exuberant wit;<br />
  But if ever a trick on the clergy you play,<br />
  You'll speedily find there's the "dickens to pay."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
There are bikes at your service, and motors galore.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  To angels&mdash;when met&mdash;be extremely polite,<br />
  Attentions too forward they'll keenly requite;<br />
  Don't ruffle their feathers; just let them alone.<br />
  Else, if you're converted, 'twill be into stone;<br />
  Don't chum with low people, unruly and bold.<br />
  And be left, when they've done with you, "out in the cold."<br />
  Don't be far too clever; but seek to be good,<br />
  And when you're at Lincoln behave as you should:<br />
  Step into the Minster the Imp to behold.<br />
  Who points to the truth of the tale that I've told.<br />
  So visit old Lindum, a city most rare;<br />
  Of course take a ticket, and pay the due fare!<br />

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
